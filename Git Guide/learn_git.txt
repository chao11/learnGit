# initialiser le répertoire
	git init

# ajouter le fichier dans stage
	git add file1 file2

# commit to master
	git commit -m "comment"

# ============================================================================================
# Bachtrack and reset: 
    git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory.
    git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.
    git reset SHA: Can be used to reset to a previous commit in your commit history.

# ============================================================================================
# lister les branches
	git branch

# créer un nouveau branch
	git branch branch_name

# changer le branch
	git checkout branch_name

# delete branch
	git branch -d branch_name

# liste the remote repositories:
	git remote -v
# default name: origin. each remote has two :fecth and push

# clone the remote project to your local space 
	git clone remote_location local_name

# check if changes have made to remote and bring the changes down to your local copy:
	git fetch 

# fecth not merge the chages from the remote to your local repository but in the remote_branch. Merge the changes:
	git merge origin/master

# ============================================================================================
# The workflow for Git collaborations typically follows this order:

   1. Fetch and merge changes from the remote
   2. Create a branch to work on a new project feature
   3. Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work
   4. Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working)
   5. Push your branch up to the remote for review
Steps 1 and 4 are a safeguard against merge conflicts, which occur when two branches contain file changes that cannot be merged with the git merge command. 


# ============================================================================================
A remote is a Git repository that lives outside your Git project folder. Remotes can live on the web, on a shared network or even in a separate folder on your local computer.
The Git Collaborative Workflow are steps that enable smooth project development when multiple collaborators are working on the same Git project.


We also learned the following commands

    git clone: Creates a local copy of a remote.
    git remote -v: Lists a Git project's remotes.
    git fetch: Fetches work from the remote into into the local copy.
    git merge origin/master: Merges origin/master into your local branch.
    git push origin <branch_name>: Pushes a local branch to the origin remote.
